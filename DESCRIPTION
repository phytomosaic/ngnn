Description: Nonlinear Gradient Nearest Neighbors, a method
          for predicting multivariate species compositions from
          environmental variables based on individualistic but
          possibly coordinated species responses. Nonlinear responses
          are possible, which improves upon existing gradient nearest
          neighbors methods. Package also includes methods for other
          ecological tasks, including in-sample NMS ordination,
          out-of-sample NMS prediction, Nonparametric Constrained
          Ordination (NCO), Nonparametric Multiplicative Regression
          (NPMR), and simplified Gradient Nearest Neighbors (GNN).
